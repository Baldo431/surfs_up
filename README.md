# Surf-Weather-Analysis

## **Overview**
---

### Purpose
Aid a potential surf and shake shop in determining if their business model is sustainable year-round in Oahu, Hawawii. At the request of the business, this will be achieved utilizing Python, Pandas and SQLite to gather and analyze weather data for the months of June and December. 

<br />

## **Results**
---

### Major Points
1. Temperature is on average approximately 4 degrees colder in December.
2. The coldest recorded temperature in December is 8 degrees colder than the coldest temperature in June. 
This is twice the average difference of 4 degrees.
3. June has more datapoints than December.
4. Neither dataset has skewed data.
5. Both datasets have outliers

## **Summary**
---
Based on the gathered data, on average the temperature is relatively stable year round. Although the temperature does drop in December, it is not significant on average to deter sales of surfing and ice cream.

Having said that, due to the presence of outliers, in particular the outliers of low temperatures present in December, there may be a concern regarding the frequency of these outliers.

Additional queries that could help make a better informed decision would be:
1. Statistics for other cold months.
2. List of cold temperatures of outliers in December and the count of these outliers.
3. Statistics for June and December broken down by year to see if there are any trends as years have gone by.
4. Precipitation statistics for June and December. If it rains more often, this may decrease the days that people go out to surf and buy ice cream.
5. Breakdown of how many of the temperature measurements were taken by each station to see if there is any bias being created by not having enough stations collect data.
